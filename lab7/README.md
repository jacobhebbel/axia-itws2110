Lab 7: The purpose of this lab was to practice PHP and SQL by creating a webpage to recreate a spookier version of an LMS. The project focused on building a functional, dynamic web application that could store, retrieve, and display data from a database while incorporating a visually engaging spooky theme (yay halloween!). Our goal was to combine back-end development with front-end design, focusing on database interactions, server-side scripting, and user interface elements. By completing this lab, the goal was to strengthen our skills in SQL query design, PHP integration with HTML, and the creation of interactive web pages that respond to user input. The team collaborated on database design, query development, page styling, and debugging to successfully implement the lab requirements. Below, you will find the SQL queries ran for our database.
