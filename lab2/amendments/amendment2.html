        <h2>Amendment II</h2>
        <p class="quoted">"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."</p>
        <div class="analysis">
            <p>The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects the right of the people to keep and bear arms. Originally, this amendment was created to allow the creation of a local militia, a temperary military force made up of civilians in the event of emergency, to ensure they could fight back against an oppressive government. Since this is seen as an extreme scenario in modern America, this amendment is now popularly understood as protecting an individual's right to own firearms. Today, the right to bear arms is the subject of increased controversy, as the government must balance the protection of individual rights with efforts to reduce gun violence.</p>
