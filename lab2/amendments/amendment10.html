        <p class="quoted">"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."</p>
        <div class="analysis">
            <p>This amendment indicates that any powers that the Constitution does not specifically provide the federal government nor prohibit from the States will be given to the States and the people to use. This amendment was created to clearly define the balance of power between the state and the federal governments. It presents that the only powers the federal government possess are the ones specifically stated and enumerated.</p>
