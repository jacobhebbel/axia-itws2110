        <h2>Article VI</h2>
        <p class="quoted">
            "All Debts contracted and Engagements entered into, before the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be as valid against the United States under this Constitution, as under the Confederation.<br><br>
            
            This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.<br><br>
            
            The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States."
        </p>
        <div class="analysis">
            <p>Article VI covers three major points: (1) it confirms that debts and obligations from before the Constitution remain valid, ensuring continuity; (2) it establishes the “Supremacy Clause,” making the Constitution, federal laws, and treaties the highest law of the land, taking precedence over conflicting state laws; and (3) it requires all government officials: federal and state to swear an oath to support the Constitution, while prohibiting religious tests for public office, ensuring religious freedom in governance.</p>
