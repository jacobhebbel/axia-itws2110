        <p class="quoted">"The Ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the Same."</p>

            <p>Article VII sets the process for the Constitution to take effect. It required approval by conventions in nine of the thirteen states to establish the Constitution as the new framework of government. This article provided the legal foundation for the transition from the Articles of Confederation to the Constitution, and it highlights the framers’ intent to rely on the people’s representatives in state conventions for legitimacy.</p>
